				<section><ul><li class="fragment">Nobody had enough electoral votes to win. In turn, this invoked
					the Twelfth amendment because there was no clear result.</li><li class="fragment">Under the Twelfth Amendment, any ties in the electoral college are
to be broken by the House of Representatives among the top three
candidates.</li></ul></section>
				<section><h2>Corrupt Bargain</h2><ul><li class="fragment">Since the voting in the House only takes into consideration the top
					three candidates, Henry Clay was out of the running.</li><li class="fragment">
Supposedly, John Quincy Adams had a meeting with Henry Clay
saying that, if he endorsed him and gave him his support, he would
					make him his Secretary of State.</li><li class="fragment">Henry Clay agreed since many Secretary of States became
presidents later on in their career, so he could use this as a
stepping stone in the grand scheme of things for him.</li></ul></section>
				<section><h2>Or Did It?</h2></section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>The story says that there was some shady behind the curtain
meeting, but nobody can actually prove it. So far, there is no such
correspondence or documents that prove the very existence of this
"bargain".</li>
						<li>It must be taken into account that this story was spread by
Jackson's supporters.</li>
						<li>History may never know if this bargain actually happened or things
just worked out for Andrew Jackson and he used it to his tactical
advantage.</li>
					</ul></section>
				<section><p>It is well known that Andrew Jackson's campaign for the Election of
1828 began the very day he lost in the contingent election of 1825. This corrupt bargain, regardless of its validity, had created a
shadow of doubt on John Quincy Adams. It was perfect for Jackson
to take advantage and realize his goal of becoming the United
States president.</p></section>
				<section><h3>Review</h3><ul><li>Who were the top three candidates in the election of 1824 who
					moved onto the contingent election of 1825?</li>
					<li>Which amendment was invoked by the Election of 1824?</li>
					<li>What is the theory behind the victory of John Quincy Adams?</li></ul></section>
				<section><h3>Canvas Discussion</h3><ul><li>If you were on Adams side and the Corrupt Bargain had occurred,
					how would defend your political actions?<li><li>If you were on Jacksons side and the Corrupt Bargain had not
					occurred, how would defend your political actions?</li><li>Do you think the "Corrupt Bargain" actually occurred? Why?</li>
					<li>How does it relate to recent events?</li></ul></section>
